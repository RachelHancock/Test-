		<h1>ENGL 5523: Technical Writing for Online Audiences 
		<h2>Syllabus and Policies &amp; Procedures</h2>
		<h3>Course Description</h3>
		<p>Online writing poses a special challenge for writers as the traditional norms of print publication (and the control they give over presentation) get tossed out the window. Texts are expected to not only make the leap to the web successfully, but to look great across any number of devices while doing so. In many smaller organizations, a technical writer may even find him or herself as the sole person responsible for maintaining the entire organization&rsquo;s web presence. In this course, we&rsquo;ll tackle the challenge of writing for online audiences by giving technical and professional writers the tools and theory they need to write successfully online, including an understanding of HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design, and the ways web standards impact successful online writing. We&rsquo;ll also focus some on creating an organization&rsquo;s web presence, and the process of maintaining editorial control over the content of such sites using standard HTML/CSS as well as content management systems such as Drupal.</p>
