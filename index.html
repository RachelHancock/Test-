		<h1>ENGL 5523: Technical Writing for Online Audiences 
		<h2>Syllabus and Policies &amp; Procedures</h2>
		<h3>Course Description</h3>
		<p>Online writing poses a special challenge for writers as the traditional norms of print publication (and the control they give over presentation) get tossed out the window. Texts are expected to not only make the leap to the web successfully, but to look great across any number of devices while doing so. In many smaller organizations, a technical writer may even find him or herself as the sole person responsible for maintaining the entire organization&rsquo;s web presence. In this course, we&rsquo;ll tackle the challenge of writing for online audiences by giving technical and professional writers the tools and theory they need to write successfully online, including an understanding of HTML, CSS, Responsive Web Design, and the ways web standards impact successful online writing. We&rsquo;ll also focus some on creating an organization&rsquo;s web presence, and the process of maintaining editorial control over the content of such sites using standard HTML/CSS as well as content management systems such as Drupal.</p>

		<h3>Assignments and Due Dates</h3><br>
		<h4><i><b>Major Assignments</i></b></h4>
		<p><li>Weekly Readings Response (Due...)<br>
			Each week, you&rsquo;ll have an assigned response to our readings. This response will ask that you talk about the impact of the particular readings for a given week, integrate those readings into a broader context, and apply them to your own profession/workplace. These responses will vary from assignment topics to open responses with minimal guidance.<br>
			<li>Sandbox Site (Due...)<br>
			Each week, you&rsquo;ll maintain a sandbox site via the university&rsquo;s COMP server. You&rsquo;ll be expected to use this site to try out some of the techniques we&rsquo;ll be discussing in readings each week, and often you&rsquo;ll be tasked between classes to implement a planned site feature that we&rsquo;ve covered during our weekly meeting. This work at times (perhaps often) will be collaborative and will provide you a space to freelyt est out ideas and push your skills in formatting content for the web. A content management site will eventually accompany this sandbox site when we transition to the second half of the semester.<br>
			<li>Site Critique (Due...)<br>
				For our first major assignment with a due date, you&rsquo;ll complete a critique of an existing site. Your critique will need to integrate our readings on visual rhetoric, usability, as well as usability testing of the site in question<br>
		    <li>Site Project Part 1 (Due...)<br>
		    	For the first part of your site project, you will need to propose working with a client on your own personal project for a website or equivalent work with HTML/CSS or a content management system. Your initial project report will map out the stakeholders for the project, the purpose, goals, markers for success, and a timeline for your work.
		    <li>Site Project Part 2 (Due...)<br>
		    	The final portion of your project will be the submission of the site or equivalent work, along with a report on the final project. The report should include a summary of your project, your design choices, your rationale for those choices, and the results of your usability testing on the site or equivalent project.<br>
		    <h4><i><b>Other Assignments</i></b></h4>
		    <li>Github Account<br>
		    	As part of your participation in the course, you&rsquo;ll be expected to maintain a Github account (we&rsquo;ll go over this early on) that will serve as a backup for your HTML/CSS projects. These accounts will also support teamwork from time to time.
		    <li>In-Class Team Projects<br>
		    	During the semester, we&rsquo;ll often have a team project that will serve as the focus for our application of the week&rsquo;s readings. You&rsquo;ll work in pairs or threes to put together a project that makes use of the content we&rsquo;ve discussed in that week&rsquo;s readings (and previous readings) to solve a particular problem. These projects at times will leak over into your sandbox site work.<br>
		    <li>In-Class Technique Sharing<br>
		    	From time to time we&rsquo;ll work together to educate each other in class as to specific techniques that we&rsquo;ve found useful for shaping content for the web. You&rsquo;ll be asked from time to time to share a particularly effective technique that you discovered with the rest of the class in an informal fashion.<br>
		    <li>Discussions<br>
		    	You&rsquo;ll be expected to take part in classroom discussions that will be the driving force of many of our face-to-face meetings. Respectful participation is expected.</p>
